# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists, in respects to the learning of this class, design, program and deploy machine learning algorithms. The work that computer scientists do help make people's lives easier. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I break a problem down into small digestible tasks. Each task would be prioritized and worked through. I test each function I write that ensure the code is operational.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It is my job to ensure that the code I write is written in a well-managed way. In writing machine learning algorithms, I need to check for bias and misinformation regularly to save the reputation of the product and 
the organization.
